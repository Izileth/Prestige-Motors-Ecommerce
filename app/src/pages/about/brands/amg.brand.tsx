                Founded in 1967 by Hans Werner Aufrecht and Erhard Melcher in Gro√üaspach, Germany, AMG began as an
                engineering office specializing in the design, testing, and development of racing engines. Their vision was
                simple yet ambitious: to transform standard Mercedes-Benz vehicles into high-performance machines capable of
                dominating on the track and thrilling on the road.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
                From humble beginnings in a former mill, AMG quickly gained a reputation for its meticulous craftsmanship
                and innovative engine tuning, laying the groundwork for a legacy of unparalleled automotive excellence.
